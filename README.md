# Motion-Tree-CoreData - RubyMotion NSOutline & CoreData example
A port of the example from [Connecting NSOutlineView to Core Data in 10.6 Part 1: Ordered Trees](http://lifeasclay.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/connecting-nsoutlineview-to-core-data-in-10-6-part-1-ordered-trees/) to rubymotion.

## Notes
To make this example work I had to rename the entity `group` to folder and the attribute `name` to `folderName`. I earlier encountered problems when I had an attribute called `description`.
